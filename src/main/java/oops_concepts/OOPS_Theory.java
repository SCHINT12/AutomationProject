	 * 2. Polymorphism
	 * 
	 * a) Method overloading  - 1 class
	 * b) Method overriding   - 2 classes
	 * 
	 * a) Method overloading : same method name with different data types or different number of parameters
	 * 
	 *     If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, 
	 *     it is known as Method Overloading.
	 *     
	 *     public  int sum(int a , int b)
	{
		return a+b;
	}
	
	public static float sum(int a , float b)
	{
		System.out.println(a+b);
		return a+b;
	}


	 * b) Method overriding: same method name , same number of parameters
	 * 
	 * If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, 
	 * it is known as method overriding in Java.

       In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method 
       that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.
       
       can we overload main method ? Yes
       
       can we overload static method ? Yes
       
       Can we override main method ? No
       
       can we override static method ? No

	 *  3. Abstraction 
	 *  
	 *  showing only functionality and hiding the internal details
	 *  
	 *  User cannot create object for abstract class
	 *  User cannot create object for interface
	 *  
	 *    abstraction  -> abstract class - 0-100%
	 *    abstraction -> interface       - 100%
	 *    
	 *    class - class -> extends
	 *    class - interface -> implements
	 *    interface-class -> implements
	 *    interface-interface -> extends
	 *    
	 *    multiple inheritance is not possible through classes , 
	 *    possible through interfaces 
	 *

	 *    WebDriver TakesScreenshot JavaScriptExecutor
	 *    
	 *    4 Encapsulation
	 * 
	 * 
	 *   Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit
